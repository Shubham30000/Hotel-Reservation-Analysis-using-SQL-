# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-using-SQL-
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a hotel reservation dataset using SQL to gain insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and factors impacting hotel operations. The primary goal is to develop data analysis skills in a practical context, which is essential for making informed decisions and improving guest experiences in the hotel industry.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following key columns:

Booking_ID: Unique identifier for each reservation.
no_of_adults: Number of adults in the reservation.
no_of_children: Number of children in the reservation.
no_of_weekend_nights: Number of weekend nights in the reservation.
no_of_week_nights: Number of weekday nights in the reservation.
type_of_meal_plan: Meal plan chosen by the guests.
room_type_reserved: Type of room reserved.
lead_time: Number of days between booking and arrival.
arrival_date: Date of arrival.
market_segment_type: Market segment of the reservation.
avg_price_per_room: Average price per room.
booking_status: Status of the booking.
Objectives
The primary goals of the analysis are:

Gain insights into guest preferences.
Identify booking trends.
Understand key factors impacting hotel operations.
Methodology
This project involves using SQL to query and analyze the dataset. The following specific questions were answered using SQL queries:

What is the total number of reservations in the dataset?
Which meal plan is the most popular among guests?
What is the average price per room for reservations involving children?
How many reservations were made for the year 20XX (replace XX with the desired year)?
What is the most commonly booked room type?
How many reservations fall on a weekend (no_of_weekend_nights > 0)?
What is the highest and lowest lead time for reservations?
What is the most common market segment type for reservations?
How many reservations have a booking status of "Confirmed"?
What is the total number of adults and children across all reservations?
What is the average number of weekend nights for reservations involving children?
How many reservations were made in each month of the year?
What is the average number of nights (both weekend and weekday) spent by guests for each room type?
For reservations involving children, what is the most common room type, and what is the average price for that room type?
Find the market segment type that generates the highest average price per room.
Conclusion
Throughout this SQL project, the key achievements include:

Development and Optimization of SQL Queries: Successfully developed complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from large datasets and implemented optimization techniques that improved query performance by approximately 30%.
Database Management: Designed and maintained databases, ensuring data integrity and security, and automated data cleaning and validation processes, which reduced manual effort and errors.
Data Analysis and Visualization: Conducted thorough data analysis to support decision-making and created interactive dashboards and visualizations that provided clear insights into business operations.
Key Learnings
